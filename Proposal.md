# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Connecting 4x4


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Our project is a game that presents the user with 16 words in a grid, which are split into 4 groups of 4 words. The user has to guess the premises of the 4 groups and choose 4 words that go together 4 separate times.  


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our software will shuffle a list of 16 words, and then randomly assign each word into a bax and form a 4x4 grid. From there, the user will have to choose 4 groups of 4 words in which each group is tied together by a common theme (such as they all start with vowels). Each group's "common theme" will be varying in difficulty, starting from easy to extremely difficult. When the user selects a group correctly, the words will be put together to make the appearance more organized. Additionally, the user will also only have 4 trys to group the words correctly


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Heidi Wright tuu53423@temple.edu Tomoya Kanno
Leysan Sultanbekova tuk48040@temple.edu Tomoya Kanno


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome would be to have the user choose 4 words that go together, but the words will then not be grouped together , and instead we will just have the game show them that they are correct. No matter what, we will accomplish the 4x4 grid of 16 words so that the user has that choice. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome would be to still have the user choose 4 words, but then have that group of words be compartmentalized together to make the appearance more organized. This would happen after every group of words they choose.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for our project would have all the processes above be completed, and additionally have visuals - such as adding assigned colors based on each group's difficulty level after the user correctly chooses the groups. Additionally, in our best outcome, we would have the choice of having the words that would not yet be chosen to be shuffled around for the user's comfort. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Our immediate next steps would be to make the groups of 4 words that are tied together by a common theme. Our next steps would then be to learn and research how to make a gride on vscode, and assign each word into each box. From there, we would have to learn how to make our code interactive with the user, as they will be choosing the boxes based on what they group they think each word is in. As to each of our roles, Heidi would make the grid of the 16 words and assign each word to a box. Leysan would then do the code that distinguishes whether the user's chosen groups are correct or wrong, and assign True to if each group is correct or False and keep the words in the same place if the grouped words are not chosen correctly. Lastly, I would compartmentalize the correctly chosen groups into rows to make the appearance of the game easier and add visuals (like colors).
